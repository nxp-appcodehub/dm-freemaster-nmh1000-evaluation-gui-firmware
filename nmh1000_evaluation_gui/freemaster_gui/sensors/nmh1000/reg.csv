After asserting to 1, the MDO bit retains this value after the register $03 returns to the range of $00 to $1F, until a read operation is performed on register $00.

0: Register $03 value is within the range $00 to $1F.
1: Register $03 value is >$1F indicates out-of-range or fault; Result of reset.","Magnetic data ready indicates the value in register $03 is available for read operation.

register $00. After asserting to 1, the RST_STAT bit retains this value after the exit of POR or soft rest, until a read operation is performed on register $00. The RST_STAT reasserts if POR or soft reset is entered.
0: Reset sequence complete and read operation performed on register $00.
1: Reset sequence not complete; Result of reset.","Output buffer indicates a latched state of the OUT pin after a transition from
either Asserted to Clear or Clear to Asserted. After asserting to 1, or clearing
to 0, the OUT_B bit retains this value until a read operation is performed on
register $00. This bit is intended to allow the user or tester to check for a
transition while the actual OUT pin or OUTPUT bit may have changed state

0: Write to 0 has no effect; Read of 0 indicates I2C mode; Result of reset. 
1: Write to 1 forces the device from I2C mode to standalone mode; Read of 1 indicates a state machine fault, since the registers are only accessible in the I2C mode.","AUTO provides control of the state machine to enter a sequential autonomous mode cycling from sleep to compare to Vout control, then back to sleep, for example. The sequence is halted when the AUTO is written to 0.
0: Write to 0 halts or prevents autonomous mode; Read of 0 indicates that autonomous mode is not active; Result of reset.
1: Write to 1 starts the autonomous mode; Read of 1 indicates that autonomous mode is active.","ONE_SHOT provides control of the state machine to trigger a single sequence of compare to Vout control, then halt. The bit clears upon the sequence being completed.
0: Write to 0 has no effect; Read of 0 indicates One-Shot is not active; Result of reset.
1: Write to 1 triggers a one-shot sequence; Read of 1 has no effect.",,"RST provides I2C access to force an internal device soft reset:
